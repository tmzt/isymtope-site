This is the website for Isymtope. Please visit https://isymtope.org.

To build this site you will need [Cobalt](https://cobalt.org). You will also need the *sass* feature enabled to compile the stylesheets.

You can install it with:

```bash
cargo install cobalt-bin --features=sass --force
```

The site is built and deployed on pushes to `master` using Travis CI.
